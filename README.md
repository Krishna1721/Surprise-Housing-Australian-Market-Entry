# Surprise-Housing-Australian-Market-Entry
# Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a regression model to predict house prices in the Australian market. The project aims to assist Surprise Housing, a US-based company, in understanding significant predictors and price dynamics for profitable investments.

# Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Australian house sales, is available in the file: australian_house_data.csv.

# Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
scripts: Python scripts for utility functions and data processing.
models: Saved models and model evaluation metrics.
# Model Development
The project focuses on:
Identifying significant predictors influencing house prices.
Building regression models utilizing Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques.
